<h1>Clean energy is not always so clean</h1>
<h5>By Lauren Smith</h5>

<p>In the fight to reduce carbon emissions, much of the world has begun to explore alternatives to fossil fuel. This has led to technological pursuits like hydropower, biofuel, solar energy and other initiatives that have been dubbed “clean energy.” </p>


<p>Various forms of this clean energy technology are growing and being adopted more every day. As of 2024, U.S. biofuel production and consumption levels were more than five times what they were in 2004. In December of 2024, the Chinese government approved the construction of what will become the world’s largest hydropower plant. Most agree that clean energy initiatives are invaluable in the global mitigation and adaptation strategy.</p>


<p>However, scientists and activists alike have begun to interrogate whether clean energy is really the savior it has been painted as. While clean energy technology does not have the exact same climate impacts as fossil fuels, certain cases have proved that there are drawbacks.</p>


<p>According to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), dams and reservoirs associated with hydropower plants can disrupt the ecology and physical characteristics of rivers by changing river flow, water chemistry and temperature and more. These changes threaten native plants and animals and in some cases, lead to displacement of people inhabiting the surrounding area.</p>

<p>This has been seen in the Brahmaputra River valley in India. To honor its climate commitments, the Indian government has poured immense time and money into a multitude of hydropower projects along the river in Northeast India, to which melting Himalayan glaciers provide an abundant water supply. On paper, the effort is a major success. </p>


<p>However, indigenous populations are having their livelihoods threatened by hydropower projects. Inhabitants of the surrounding area, many living downstream from these large dams, are facing devastating floods that destroy homes and ecosystems. Additionally, dams create irregular water flow, impeding fish movement and disrupting sediment flow, hurting agriculture. Agricultural products like rice and fish from the river are central to the diets of the local community. Despite the dams being directly upstream, these communities do not receive any employment opportunities or hydroelectricity for their troubles.</p>

<p>China’s planned Medog Hydropower Station, which will be placed further north on the same river, began construction in July 2025, is threatening to displace natives of the Tibetan region, who have already suffered from landslides due to glacial collapse. A previous Chinese hydropower plant, the Three Gorges Dam, displaced over a million Tibetans.</p>

<p>Other forms of clean energy such as biofuel can even severely threaten human health, same as nonrenewable coal. The citizens of Cook County, Georgia, many of them Black and Latine, are suffering in droves from asthma and heart disease caused by the air pollution coming from local biomass plants.</p>

<p>Even when we look closer to home, in Cook County Georgia, we see how clean energy production can be harmful and exploitative. In 2021, a local group mobilized citizens of Adel, Georgia to oppose the permission and construction of the second wood pellet plant built in the local area. Biomass fuel is often made from burning wood pellets and other primarily lumber related materials. The process releases particles that damage air quality for miles around the plant. The air quality can lead to severe health conditions including asthma, heart disease, and cancer.  </p>

<p>So it turns out that clean energy is not so clean after all. Marginalized populations are fighting against exploitative energy production that is greenwashed and presented to the public as harmless. It behooves climate activists and global citizens to acknowledge the human costs of this technology. As new sources of energy emerge, marginalized communities are left to suffer for the benefit of climate strategy.</p>

<p>It is time to start airing out the dirty laundry and looking for solutions and alternatives. Researchers work to advance our technology and our understanding every day. There is a chance to improve the methods of production for hydropower and biofuel. </p>

<p>Clean energy is a viable alternative in the interest of lowering carbon emissions, but little attention has been paid to the full impacts. The global community cannot afford to be careless about where and how it gets energy, and it is clearly not enough to simply choose anything but fossil fuels. The lesser evil should not be an option when striving for sustainable development. The work is not done if the solution causes more suffering.</p>
