    <title>Upside Down Peach Cake - Perfect Summer Dessert</title>

<body>
    <h1>Upside Down Peach Cake</h1>
    <p>This is my absolute favourite peach upside down cake. Grab all your ingredients and fresh local peaches near you and get baking. In a cast iron caramelise sugar, top with sliced ripe peaches, a drizzle of bourbon if you like, then top that off with a thick buttery, nutty batter that has a hint of cardamom which compliments the juicy peaches perfectly. Bake until golden, let cool slightly and  flip for the moment of truth</p>

        <li>Cook over medium-high heat, gently swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until light amber, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cast iron from the heat and arrange your sliced peaches in a circle around the skillet creating 2 or 3
            layers of peaches.</li>
        <li>If using bourbon, drizzle on your set the skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Place your pecans in a blender and pulse until mostly ground. It should be uniform with no big pieces.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, ground pecans, cardamom, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl.</li>

        <li>Pour the batter over the peaches and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Place your skillet in the oven and bake for about 50 minutes until the cake is golden. A toothpick should come out clean when inserted.</li>
        <li>If you cake browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Let sit for 15 minutes, then gently use a knife to run around the edges of the cake and invert onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Enjoy on its own or with ice cream or whipped cream. To store, cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge.</li>
